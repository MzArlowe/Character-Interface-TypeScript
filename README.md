# Character-Interface using TypeScript
 
 This was an awesome challenge in which we had to design two character classes and have them battle to the death. 
 
 The characters had to be able to attack and defend. They had to have a health bar and they had to be able to recoop their health by resting. 
 
 The attacks and defense/ misses had to be randomized.
 
 The fun part of all of this, I learned that you could use emojis in code. 🤯Mind Blown!
